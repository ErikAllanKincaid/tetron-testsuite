# meta:description Live connectivity check for the Veilid transport (VEILID-001..019, external-daemon architecture): install the tetron-veilid companion daemon on both nodes, create --veilid -> restart -> join --veilid -> restart -> restart node1 again (confound-free steady-state check, VEILID-012) -> asserts a Veilid path candidate with real traffic appears in tetron status --json's paths[], on both sides.
# meta:nodes 2
# meta:networks 1
#
# Requires a tetron binary built with `--features veilid`
# (`cargo build --release --features veilid` in the tetron repo). Not part
# of run-list.txt by default -- run explicitly: ./bin/tetron-testsuite veilid-smoke
#
# UPDATED 2026-09-14 for VEILID-017..019 (tetron/spec/core.py): tetron's
# own veilid-transport crate no longer embeds a Veilid node -- it is a
# thin client to an external `tetron-veilid` companion daemon (a separate
# addon repo, ~/code/tetron-veilid), the same shape --tor already has to a
# local Tor daemon. This test now installs a real tetron-veilid instance
# (the actual released binary, fetched from GitHub the same way a real
# user's install would) on each node *before* tetron itself ever runs
# --veilid -- without it, `tetron create/join --veilid` still succeeds
# (the roster/CLI plumbing doesn't require the daemon to be reachable),
# but the custom transport itself never carries any traffic, since
# there is nothing at 127.0.0.1:5959 to connect to.
#
# Both nodes' Veilid transport only starts on the *second* daemon boot
# for a given node (the shared endpoint's custom transports are fixed at
# process startup, before --veilid has even reached config on the first
# create/join against an already-running daemon) -- unaffected by the
# external-daemon rewrite, since this is tetron's own startup sequencing,
# not veilid-transport's internals. Each `tetron restart` below is not
# incidental cleanup, it is the step that actually starts Veilid.
#
# Unlike the pre-VEILID-017 embedded design, tetron-veilid itself is never
# restarted here, only tetron -- so unlike the old design's "every restart
# is a brand-new Veilid identity" behavior (VEILID-019's own docstring:
# "a fresh tetron-veilid process is a fresh Veilid identity"), each node's
# Veilid identity should now stay stable across tetron's own restarts,
# since the daemon that owns that identity never itself restarts. This
# test does not yet rely on that (keeps the original conservative
# multi-restart structure and settle windows below) -- worth revisiting
# once this is confirmed reliable, since it may mean the timing margins
# here are now more generous than actually needed.
#
# Asserts a Veilid PATH CANDIDATE with real activity appears in paths[],
# not that conn_type itself becomes "Veilid": these two VMs share a LAN,
# so Direct is always reachable too, and tetron's own choose_path_index
# (daemon/mesh/select.rs) deliberately ranks Direct > Relay > Tor > Veilid
# -- Direct will always win the SELECTED slot here, correctly, by design.
# A dedicated Veilid-only topology (isolating direct+relay so Veilid is
# the only viable path) is what it would take to see conn_type itself
# become "Veilid" live; not attempted by this test.
#
# Neither node's embedded Veilid identity is persisted across a restart
# (a separate, known limitation), so the two restarts above each race a
# brand-new identity against the connection re-forming -- the hardest
# timing this mechanism ever faces, not the steady-state case a real,
# long-running node settles into once its identity is known and
# published. A third restart, of node1 (the coordinator) only, checks
# that steady-state case with no propagation race left to lose: node1's
# restore path reloads its roster from the already-published signed
# blob, which by then already has node2's still-valid `veilid_node_id`
# from the settle after node2's own restart.
