# meta:description CONVERGE-012: a coordinator now actually attempts outbound redial against an unreachable member, instead of dialing once at restore and never trying again
# meta:nodes 2
# meta:networks 1
#
# Before CONVERGE-012, a coordinator's only outbound dial mechanism
# (dial_all_members) ran exactly once, at daemon/network restore; a
# member it lost mid-session was cleaned up (dead route removed) but
# never redialed, for the rest of that process's life -- see
# tetron/DO-NOT-COMMIT/oom-leak-investigation/
# FINDINGS_CoordinatorHasNoOutboundReconnectLoop_2026-08-15.md.
#
# This test isolates the specific, previously-completely-absent behavior:
# does the coordinator itself now *attempt* an outbound dial against a
# member that goes offline mid-session? It deliberately does not assert
# on which side's dial eventually "wins" the reconnection once the member
# comes back -- the member's own restart-triggered dial and the
# coordinator's CONVERGE-012 redial task both race for that, and
# attributing the win to one side specifically would need an asymmetric
# network-partition primitive this suite's topology.sh does not have yet
# (a real follow-up, not faked here). node2 is therefore left stopped for
# the whole test, never restarted -- this proves the coordinator retries
# on its own, not that it eventually wins a race.
